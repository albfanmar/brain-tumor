A classification of different types of brain tumors by image processing using CNN
This image dataset containing samples of meningioma(1), glioma(2), pituitary tumor(3) brain tumor types. These files were converted from the ".mat" file format to the ".png" format by Jun Cheng.

In this exercise I have trained a simple CNN model and then a pretrained model, specifically the efficientnet-b3, to classify images of the three types of tumors. Then I have united them in an ensemble.
It can be seen that the ensemble model achieves better performance than either of the other two models individually.
